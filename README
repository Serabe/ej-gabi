==Install dependencies:

    npm install

==Test it!

You can run mocha directly

    mocha --compilers coffee:coffee-script

or use npm instead:

    npm test

Implement it!

Write code in src/MyNumber.coffee and make all your tests pass! Each
time a new test passes, commit it so I can take a look at it.
